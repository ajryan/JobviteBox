                <p>'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.</p>
                <p>'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's  perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.</p>
                <p>The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from  one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in  the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring  a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.</p>
                <p>'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to herself,  as well as she could for sneezing.</p>
                <p>There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess  sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling  alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen  that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on  the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.</p>
                <p>'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was  not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why  your cat grins like that?'</p>
                <p>'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!'</p>
                <p>She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite  jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,  and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:&mdash;</p>
                <p>'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know  that cats COULD grin.'</p>
                <p>'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.'</p>
